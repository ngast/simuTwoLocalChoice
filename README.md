# Simulation of local two choice

This repository contains the code to reproduce all simulations of the paper: 

The power of two choices on graphs: the pair-approximation is accurate?
N Gast - ACM SIGMETRICS Performance Evaluation Review, 2015 

It contains:
- a C++ code to simulation a version of the supermarket with locality
- a python code that implements the mean field approximation and pair approximation
- a notebook that compares simulation and approximation.
